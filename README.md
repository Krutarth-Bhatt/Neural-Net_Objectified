# Neural-Net_Objectified
A self coded ANN which can be trained on any data for classification or logistic regression.

<pre>
Hi there,
This is a self coded Neural-Net, made just by using standard libraries like: 
    1) Numpy : For matrix calculation.
    2) Pandas : For handling the datasets.
    3) Matplotlib : For graph plotting.
    4) Time : For claculating computing time. 
   
The class neuralnet consists of 3 main functions:
    1) __init__ : This is python constructor used for initializing weights and biases.
    2) train : For training the net on the data.
    3) test : For test the trained net.
    
I have trained it using mnist dataset. 
The output displayed will be:
    1) The acurracy of the model on the testing data.
    2) The graph of cost function vs No. of iterations.
